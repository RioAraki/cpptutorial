# Part 1 the basics

## Chapter 2 vairables and basic types

Program's most fundamental feature:
	- built-in types
	- variables
	- expressions and statements to manipulate values of these types
	- control flow
	- functions that let us define callable units of computation

C++: type of an object determines operations. C++ checks type at compile time (Python checks type at runtime).

### 2.1 Primitive built-in types

Types determine the meaning of the data and operations in our program.

#### Arithmetic types 

Arithemetic types-> char, int, bool, float/ and void type | can also be regard as:  integral types (char, bool)/ floating-point types
Type's size may varies.

Signed and unsigned types:

	- signed: negative or positive, int/ short/ long/ long long, add unsigned to the type to get an unsigned version
	- unsigned: value >= 0, in unsigned type, all bits represent the value
	
use unsigned type if you know values cannot be negative
char could be signed or unsigned depends on computer, so caculate between char may not be a good idea.use double to do floating point calculation because float is not precise enough and cost is not that much different

#### Type conversions

Ability to convert objects of the given type to other, related types, automatically.
